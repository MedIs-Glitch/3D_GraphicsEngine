# 🖥️ 3D Modeler - Java Swing 3D Engine

This project is a **3D modeling software** built entirely in **Java Swing**.  
It allows you to create, view, and manipulate 3D models, similar to basic features of Blender.

## 🚀 Features
- Pure **Java Swing** UI (no external graphics libraries).
- **Custom 3D engine**: rendering pipeline, shading, transformations.
- **Import / Export** of 3D models (planned).
